Hello!

That's my first project using Python language. I wanted to train some things that i learned
in the last months using this programming language. Using classes, functions, for loops, PySide6 to create
Graphical User Interfaces and other things that is possible using the Python language. The calculator is not
fully functional, but makes the basics math operations like sums, multiplications, subtractions and divisions.

I hope you're reading this, enjoys it!
